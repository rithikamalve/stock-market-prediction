# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

The Stock Market Prediction project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock prices based on historical data. This project combines data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to predict future stock trends.

## Features

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Utilizes historical stock price data for training the LSTM model.
- **LSTM Model**: Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time-series prediction.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Visualizes predictions against actual stock prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for data normalization, splitting, and feature extraction.

## Technologies

- **Machine Learning**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development**: Python
